# Starboard, Renegade!
An obstensive roleplaying 'game' set in the far reaches of space in the far-off future year of 2006. In its current form, it can be used to roll various roleplaying characters, planets, or space vessels, as well as parouse a certain amount of equipment and freight, although there is no legitimate playability as of yet. 

## Major Considerations
- Planet Generator
- Equipment (Software & Computers, Firearms, Drugs, Tools, Survival Gear, etc.)
- Vessels (Space or otherwise)
- Character Generator (Childhood & Lifeskills, Education, Sebatical, Career)

## Current Files
- fnff.py | 'Friday Night Firefight', a module from Cyberpunk 2020. Two NPCs will shoot at each other until one of them falls over, unconscious. Incredibly limited in firearm capability.
- starboardRenegade.py | The main program file. In its current state, it will provide the user with a series of menus, some dead-end, that will help the layman use some of the program features.
- travCharGenerator v2.py | A half-constructed rewrite of travCharGenerator, used to test ergonomics of a few key features. Currently unusable.
- travCharGenerator.py | A basic character generator for Mongoose Traveller, constructed halfway through the 'Draft' character careers. Relatively literate.
