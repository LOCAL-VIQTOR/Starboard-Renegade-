In Cyberpunk, skills are locked in with ability scores or tied to the role level of the character. In Traveller, the
skills are fluidly exchanged with any characteristic that is required of the circumstances. I think that the fluid
aspect works better for actual play, but that assigning them works better for generation processes.
